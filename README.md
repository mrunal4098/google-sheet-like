### README: Google Sheets-Like Web Application

---

## **Project Overview**

This project is a **Google Sheets-like web application**, developed as part of an assignment, with the following core functionalities:
1. **Spreadsheet Interface** resembling Google Sheets, including a toolbar, formula bar, and cell grid.
2. **Mathematical Functions** like SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNT, and advanced ones like MEDIAN, PRODUCT, and IF.
3. **Data Quality Functions** such as TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, and FIND_AND_REPLACE.
4. **Save and Load Functionality** via a Node.js/Express backend.
5. **Chart Creation** using Chart.js to visualize data with bar, line, and pie charts.
6. **Data Entry and Validation** to support multiple data types (numbers, text, dates) and ensure correctness.
7. **Testing Interface** for users to test functions directly.
8. **Bonus Features** such as advanced formula handling, relative/absolute references, and chart integration.

## **Technology Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **React**: Used for building the dynamic user interface.
- **AG Grid**: Provides the grid-based spreadsheet functionality with features like drag-fill, editable cells, and range selection.
- **Chart.js + React-Chart.js-2**: Enables data visualization via bar, line, and pie charts.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js with Express.js**: Backend server to handle save/load functionality.
- **File-based Storage**: For simplicity, the backend uses a JSON file to store spreadsheet data.

### **Why These Technologies?**
- **React**: Its component-based architecture simplifies managing complex UI interactions.
- **AG Grid**: Offers a rich API to emulate Google Sheets functionality, reducing development time.
- **Chart.js**: Lightweight and powerful for creating interactive data visualizations.
- **Express.js**: Simple, scalable, and effective for building REST APIs.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Spreadsheet Interface**
- **Grid Design**: Editable cells with support for dynamic row/column updates.
- **Formula Bar**: Displays and allows editing of the active cell's formula or value.
- **Toolbar**: Supports bold, italic, font size, color, and other cell formatting options.
- **Drag-Fill**: Allows users to drag and copy values or formulas across cells.

### **2. Mathematical Functions**
- **Basic Functions**: SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNT.
- **Advanced Functions**: MEDIAN, PRODUCT, IF (with conditional logic).

### **3. Data Quality Functions**
- TRIM: Removes leading/trailing whitespace.
- UPPER: Converts text to uppercase.
- LOWER: Converts text to lowercase.
- REMOVE_DUPLICATES: Removes duplicate rows in a selected range.
- FIND_AND_REPLACE: Finds specific text and replaces it.

### **4. Chart Creation**
- Users can select a range and create bar, line, or pie charts.
- Chart type selection and visualization are integrated into the UI.

### **5. Save and Load**
- Backend APIs:
  - `POST /save`: Saves the current spreadsheet data by sheet ID.
  - `GET /load/:sheetId`: Loads saved spreadsheet data by sheet ID.

### **6. Data Entry and Validation**
- Supports numbers, text, and dates.
- Validates numeric cells to prevent invalid inputs.
- Provides user feedback for incorrect entries.

### **7. Testing Interface**
- Users can test formulas (e.g., `=SUM(A1:A5)`) and see results instantly.
- Displays results dynamically, including errors for invalid formulas.

## **Non-Functional Enhancements**

### **Security**
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS or injection attacks.
- Backend validation for data integrity.

### **Performance**
- Debounced updates for formula recalculation to avoid unnecessary computations.
- Optimized rendering for large datasets using AG Grid’s virtual scrolling.

### **Accessibility**
- Keyboard navigation for ease of use.
- Proper ARIA roles and labels for improved screen reader support.

## **Usage Instructions**

1. **Basic Spreadsheet Features**
   - Click a cell to edit it.
   - Use the formula bar to enter formulas like `=SUM(A1:A5)` or values like `Hello`.

2. **Formatting**
   - Use the toolbar to apply bold, italics, font size, or color to the selected cell.

3. **Testing Formulas**
   - Enter a formula in the "Test Formula" section to validate it.

4. **Chart Creation**
   - Enter numeric data in column A.
   - Click "Create Chart" and choose a chart type (bar, line, or pie).

5. **Save and Load**
   - Enter a unique sheet ID and click "Save" to store your spreadsheet.
   - Enter the same ID and click "Load" to retrieve your data.

## **Testing**

### **Key Test Cases**
1. Formula Testing:
   - Test with `=SUM(A1:A5)` where cells contain numbers.
   - Verify edge cases (empty cells, invalid references).
2. Data Validation:
   - Enter non-numeric data in numeric cells; ensure validation feedback.
3. Chart Creation:
   - Create charts for various datasets and verify accuracy.
